### Tuesday, In Class

- Please post your presentation in Slack in the channel with your name on it and provide any notes you want me to pay attention to. Please make sure your sharing settings allow me to see it (hint: open it up in a private window and see if you can see it)

### Homework

- Happy Thanksgiving!
- Develop 3 distinct visual directions for your event website. Each should include a title, description, visual research, and a homepage design. Be ready to share your work on Monday.
