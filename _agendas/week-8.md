### Homework
1. Select three of your image explorations to build out into a website series
2. Review the notes on [Figma from today&rsquo;s notes.](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Object-Posters-Internet-Art--A92Vak8CJ2FCAxD4_8z6RxcqAg-2ZfdAHDbWcpqyYl8HYps3#:uid=797366872477002478762372&h2=Figma-Notes-(for-homework))
3. Design your three object posters. Make sure to think about how they relate to each other thematically and visually. Consider how someone might navigate between the three posters and incorporate this into your design. Consider using photo, video, audio in your work (you can sketch it out in a static format, and then put it together online next week).
4. Read [In Defense of the Poor Image â€“ Hito Steyerl](https://www.e-flux.com/journal/10/61362/in-defense-of-the-poor-image/) and write a short reflection or discussion question.
