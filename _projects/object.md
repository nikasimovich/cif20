### Overview
Select an object that you will study and explore for the duration of this project. We’ll observe the physical and understood characteristics of this object and start to explore the differences between connotative, denotative and metaphorical descriptions. We’ll use the website as a canvas to gesturally express three different components of the object. Consider how you can use a mixed media approach (audio, video, imagery, text) to highlight the object in different ways. Then, consider how you’ll link the websites together and inform the user that they’re part of the same series.
