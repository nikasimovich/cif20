### Overview
Think of an event you’d like to go to as soon as it’s safe to do so. The event can be fictitious or realistic. Consider all the content necessary to house on the event website (time, place, information, etc.).

You’ll design a mobile first website that embraces the spirit of the event and contains all the relevant information for it.
